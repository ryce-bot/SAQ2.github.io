        <p>Bonifacio Global City (BGC) is located in Fort Bonifacio, 
        Taguig Philippines. It’s a modernised city with a strong economic 
        presence, and most known for things like its high-end shopping and 
        dining options, modern infrastructure, and being a big business hub. 
        Fun fact! BGC used to be part of the military camp for the Philippines 
        Army. During the American occupation it was known as Fort William 
        McKinley, but in 1957 it became a permanent HQ for the Philippine 
        Army which led to the change of name Fort Bonifacio. Though the 
        history of BGC has quite the past, it has seen an explosion of 
        popularity since then.</p>
